# SASIP: The Scale-Aware Sea Ice Project

Welcome to SASIP, an international collaborative project to better understand the impact of amplified warming in polar regions, through the development of a new sea ice modelling paradigm.

Our team includes scientists from CNRS, University of Brown, University of Reading, Sorbonne University, NERSC, CERFACS, MOI, ENPC, and CMCC.
