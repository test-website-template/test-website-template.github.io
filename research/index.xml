To accomplish this we will improve the numerical efficiency of its underlying C++ code and perform exploratory work to enable continued improvements in model efficiency beyond those immediately necessary for integrating it into a climate model. WP1 is divided into five tasks, two of which address knownshortcomings of the current model version (tasks 1.</description></item><item><title>Work Package 4</title><link>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-four/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-four/</guid><description>WP4 will complement the model development efforts of the other WPs by providing data-constrained sea ice analyses. To meet this goal we shall develop specific and novel data assimilation (DA) methods adapted to the new continuum version of neXtSIM discretised using discontinuous Galerkin method. WP4 will also use state-of-the art DA and machine learning (ML) methods not used in sea ice modeling before, and develop novel approaches for the unique computational and physical features of neXtSIM.</description></item></channel></rss>
