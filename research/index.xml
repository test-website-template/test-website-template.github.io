To accomplish this we will improve the numerical efficiency of its underlying C++ code and perform exploratory work to enable continued improvements in model efficiency beyond those immediately necessary for integrating it into a climate model.
WP1 is divided into five tasks, two of which address knownshortcomings of the current model version, two which aim to push the numerical performanceof the model further and one concerned with evaluating the physical consistency of the results obtained with the updated model code.</description></item><item><title>WP2: SEA ICE RHEOLOGY AND PHYSICAL PARAMETERIZATIONS</title><link>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-two/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-two/</guid><description>This work package is concerned with enhancing physical parameterizations within the MEB rheology using high-resolution, explicit simulations of mechanical processes within sea ice.
Where sea ice is highly fractured and/or ice concentration is low, such as in the MIZ, the continuum assumption cannot be guaranteed to hold as model resolution increases, because the spatial scale will reach that of individual floes. At that scale the mechanical behavior of ice is dominated by collisions and friction between floes.</description></item><item><title>WP5: Climate Implications</title><link>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-five/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-five/</guid><description>WP5&amp;rsquo;s work is devided into two parts:

Ocean surface waves flex and fragment sea ice altering its geometry, driving ocean mixing and sea ice melting. These effects, and their important impact on sea ice and ocean variability, are forced by variations in sea ice geometry much smaller than a continuum climate model grid scale.</description></item><item><title>WP4: DATA ASSIMILATION AND MACHINE LEARNING</title><link>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-four/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test-website-template.github.io/research/work-package-four/</guid><description>WP4 will complement the model development efforts of the other WPs by providing data-constrained sea ice analyses. To meet this goal we shall develop specific and novel data assimilation (DA) methods adapted to the new continuum version of the sea ice model neXtSIM discretised using discontinuous Galerkin method. WP4 will also use state-of-the art DA and machine learning (ML) methods not used in sea ice modeling before, and develop novel approaches for the unique computational and physical features of neXtSIM.</description></item></channel></rss>
